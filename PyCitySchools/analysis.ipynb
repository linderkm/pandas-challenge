    "# PyCity School Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis evaluates district-wide standardized reading and math test scores. The data includes specific schools, school type, school budget and school size (number of students). This report groups these data points by school, and evaluates test scores averages (math and reading) at each school. The report also sub-divides the data by school type, size and budget for targeted analysis. \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " Findings:\n",
    " \n",
    " - Student outcomes tend to decline in schools with higher per-student spending. Students performed best in schools with per-    capita budgets < 585, and students showed the worst outcomes at schools with per-capita budgets from 645-680.\n",
    " \n",
    " - Student outcomes in math and reading are similar in small (<1000) and medium (1000 to 2000) schools, but decline noticeably      in large (2000-5000) schools. \n",
    " \n",
    " - Students in charter schools so better outcomes in math and reading than students enrolled in district schools."
